# biocoding_resources
Welcome to my CS Learning Tools page. I have links to resources for learning computational skills organized by language or application. I update the list whenever I find a good new resource. 

Not sure where to start? Here is a list of the best beginner resources.

I want to really learn to program in a language I can apply to many applications: Try Python

I want to analyze spreadsheet-like data without spending hours in Excel: Try R or the Pandas package for Python

I want to analyze sequencing data: Try Computational Genomics with R

I want to analyze images: Try The Digital Cell (only in print), ImageJ Macro language, or Python with Napari & Scikit-image



## Learning Bioinformatics (General)

The digital cell : cell biology as a data science - Duke University Libraries Catalog 

^Great book with intro to using computational methods in cell biology. *There is a print copy in the library and I also have one at my desk in the lab.

Computational Genomics with R (compgenomr.github.io)

^Computational Genomics Book with good bio intro and R applications

Introduction to Computational Biology (biodatascience.github.io) 

^Class site from UNC PI and DESeq2 author Mike Love. Includes R markdown pages for each class an lots of references.

R Bioinformatics Cookbook: Use R and Bioconductor to Perform RNAseq, Genomics, Data Visualization, and Bioinformatic Analysis - Duke University Libraries Catalog 

^Protocols for many different bioinformatics tasks in R

Bioinformatics data skills - Duke University Libraries Catalog 

^General principles for efficient bioinformatics work using Unix and R

Lots of "lessons" on different basic CS & data stuff The Carpentries

scRNAseq workshop & others are recorded in CZI schedule Computational Biology Office Hours - Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (chanzuckerberg.com) 

Choose youR own Pythway (openscapes.github.io) 

^Website from pandemic-era CZI compsci meetings with links to resources

ROSALIND | Problems 

^Bioinformatics problem sets and forum

prog4biol/pfb2019: Programming for Biology 2019 (github.com)

^Beginner programming for biology from CSHL course

https://biovcnet.github.io/

^Group Krissy suggested has good Youtube videos

griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial (github.com)

^Most of the material from the "Advanced Sequencing Technologies & Bioinformatics Analysis" CSHL course


## Learning Command Line

command-line bootcamp (cli-boot.camp) 

^Exercises for learning how to use the Unix command line

Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide (tldp.org) 

^Unix textbook from beginner to intermediate shell scripting


## Learning Python

jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook: Python Data Science Handbook: full text in Jupyter Notebooks (github.com) 

^Free book and accompanying Jupyter notebooks

A Whirlwind Tour of Python | A Whirlwind Tour of Python (jakevdp.github.io) 

^Free book for people that already know how to program in another language who want to switch over to Python. I appreciate its brevity, and think it may even be useful for beginners who just want to see what's possible with Python and then can look up the specific thing they need elsewhere for more detail.

Algorithms for DNA Sequencing - Home | Coursera

^Good introduction to data structures as they apply to sequence alignment. Taught in Python

Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook 

^official tutorial of Biopython, a collection of many bioinformatics tools for Python

cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis: An introduction to data science using Python and Pandas with Jupyter notebooks (github.com) 

^recommended from CYOP


## Learning ImageJ Macros

Macro Language (nih.gov) 

^Basics to how the ImageJ macro language works

Built-in Macro Functions (nih.gov) 

^List of functions available in the ImageJ macro language

*Ask Justin, there isn't really a good resource for this, and I've spent a lot of time learning it.


## Analyzing Images with Python

napari tutorials - napari 

scikit-image: Image processing in Python â€” scikit-image

Learning R

Welcome | R for Data Science (had.co.nz) 

^Great, free beginner book for data analysis and visualization using R

Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science | Coursera

^Coursera course from JHU about using Bioconductor R packages for genomic data analysis


## Machine Learning

Introduction to Machine Learning | Coursera 

^Coursera course from Duke with a good introduction to the fundamental ideas behind machine learning. Some coding examples to reinforce concepts, but not very practical for us.

Deep Learning for the Life Sciences - Duke University Libraries Catalog 

^Textbook around DeepChem Python package for life science ML. Includes all biology examples such as TF binding to DNA and U-Net-based microscopy image segmentation.

Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition - Duke University Libraries Catalog 

^Good textbook for fundamental machine learning concepts, with good code examples.


## Developing Software

BIOS 735 - Introduction to Statistical Computing (biodatascience.github.io) 

^Class from UNC with lots on how to develop R packages

gvwilson/mrsp-growth: Managing Research Software Projects: A Model for Personal Growth (github.com) 

^workshop from someone at CZI. Takes project from 1 grad student to a full team.



Misc

Lots of course materials on Github, particularly from JHU faculty jtleek, bcaffo, and stephaniehicks.

HarvardX class on Biomedical Data science harvardx (rafalab.github.io) and accompanying book PH525x series - Biomedical Data Science (genomicsclass.github.io)
